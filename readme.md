# 🐍 Python Mini Utilities

A collection of concise Python scripts demonstrating automation, system monitoring, and visualization.  
Each script is independent, beginner-friendly, and designed to show practical Python usage in small, clear examples.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

This repository contains simple Python programs that:
- Interact with system components such as hardware and desktop notifications.  
- Perform lightweight data visualization using modern libraries.  
- Demonstrate use of commonly used third-party Python modules.  

All examples are minimal, readable, and suitable for quick learning or reuse in larger projects.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Covered

- Reading system information using `psutil`.  
- Sending desktop notifications with `plyer`.  
- Creating interactive charts with `plotly` and `pandas`.
